# discrete_copula

This repository contains the code used to analyse neuronal data using discrete copulas.

The file "copula.R" contains all the function needed to fit the discrete copula,
as well as do some other things, such as plot them, or do statistical tests.
The most important funciton here is "fit_copula".

The file "conditional.R" contains code that implements models used to model the neuronal data.
